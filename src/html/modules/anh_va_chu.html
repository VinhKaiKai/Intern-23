                        In 2005, engineer and founder Alain Clénet developed the first ergonomic adjustable bed base at his home in Santa Ynez, California. Having previously founded Clénet Coachworks, Inc. – a designer and manufacturer of limited-edition neoclassic automobiles – Clénet’s track record of creating luxury products was already well-established <br> <br>

                        Within a year of developing his adjustable bed base prototype, Alain and his son Kelly started Ergomotion – the first sleep solution for a traditional mattress that married style with innovation. <br> <br>

                        Today, Clénet's vision is a reality with nearly eight million adjustable bases sold across more than 30 countries worldwide. Over the years, Ergomotion has partnered with more than 250 major brands and has collaborated with countless innovators like Garmin, Sonos, and TempurPedic. <br> <br>

                        Ergomotion has become the leading global manufacturer and supplier of adjustable bases, with over eight million products sold across 30 countries. <br> <br>

                        And, as the owner of the global adjustable base supply chain, we are able to ensure premium product quality, sustainability, and affordability so people around the world can enjoy the wellness benefits provided by restorative sleep.
